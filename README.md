# Speech-Synthesis
## Project description
Speech synthesis, or text-to-speech, is a Web App that converts text to artificial speech. A text-to-speech system is one that reads text aloud through the computer's sound card or other speech synthesis device. Text that is selected for reading is analyzed by the software, restructured to a phonetic system, and read aloud. The computer looks at each word, calculates its pronunciation then says the word in its context .
